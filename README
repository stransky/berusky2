4. Game Rules

  In order to leave each level it is necessary to reach exit with all bugs.

  You will be meeting miscellaneous game elements while completing individual
  missions, we will try to explain their meaning now.

  Box             - It is possible to push it.
  Explosive       - Can destroy the boxes.

  Exit            - A gate to next level/exit.

  Stone           - Can be broken by a pickax.
  Pickax          - A tool for stone crushing.

  Other elements not listed here are just walls, which have no interesting
  properties. They cannot be push away nor it is possible 
  to break them anywise.
